If you used the Hakchi2 Web Installer the <kbd>Dump</kbd> folder with the kernel backup will be located in the Hakchi2 folder in <kbd>My Documents\hakchi2</kbd>, otherwise it's located in the same directory as Hakchi2. Make sure to back this file up somewhere safe in case you run into any issues and need to reflash the original kernel.

3. Select <kbd>Kernel</kbd> from the menu bar at the top of the Hakchi2 window and select <kbd>Flash custom kernel</kbd> and proceed with the on screen instructions. Leave Hakchi2 open.
