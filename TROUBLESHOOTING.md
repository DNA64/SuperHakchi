### **Troubleshooting**
If you get a C7, C8 or other error simply delete the last game you copied over from the system and power the system off. When you turn it back on you shouldn't get an error. You can also try copying and renaming images from a working game to rule out any issues with your images. Compare your <kbd>.desktop</kbd> file to mine as well. If you do get and error and you don't want to troubleshoot it, you can just flash the original kernel you dumped earlier back to the console using Hakchi2, but before you do that backup your game saves! Some users are reporting loosing game saves after reverting back to the original kernel. Saves can be found in <kbd>/var/lib/clover/profiles/0</kbd>
