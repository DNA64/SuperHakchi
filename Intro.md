### **Prologue**

This guide may look overwhelming to some but as always I try to guide you through every step of the way, in as much detail as possible, so that anyone can follow my guides. If you don't already have [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) installed, I highly recommend it! This guide assumes you do. If you don't just use any text editor.

**Update:** 
This guide assumes you're using the [Official Hakchi2 Web Installer](https://github.com/ClusterM/hakchi2/releases) not a modified version. 
Please keep this in mind when having issues. Also as progress continues so quickly, some parts of this guide may become outdated or no longer required.
